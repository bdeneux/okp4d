  ## Purpose

  The Minting Module is a fundamental component within the blockchain ecosystem, responsible for managing the dynamic
  issuance of tokens to validators, thereby ensuring the stability and sustainability of the network.
  This module operates on a continuous basis, recalculating parameters with each new block to maintain an optimal
  token supply.

  ## ðŸ§® Calculation

  The formula for calculating the yearly staking reward target (srty) is as follows:

  ```
  srty = a â€¢ i â€¢ c - b / bt
  ```

  - `srty`: Represents the yearly staking reward target.
  - `a`: Denotes the total token supply within the blockchain.
  - `i`: Refers to the inflation coefficient, a configurable parameter set at 0.073 by default.
  - `c`: Signifies the bonding ratio adjustment coefficient.
  - `b`: A dynamic variable ranging from 0 to 1, symbolizing the current bonding ratio at the current block.
  - `bt`: Represents the target bonding ratio, conventionally set to 0.66.

  ### Yearly Inflation Rate

  Upon the determination of srty, the Minting Module proceeds to convert it into a yearly inflation rate
  expressed as a percentage (Iy):

  ```
  Iy = (srty â€¢ 100) / a = (a â€¢ i â€¢ c - (b / bt) â€¢ 100) / a = i â€¢ c - (b / bt) â€¢ 100
  ```

  - `Iy` (in percentage): Represents the yearly inflation rate.

  ### Block-Level Token Minting

  With the yearly inflation rate in hand, the Minting Module can calculate the number of tokens to be minted for
  each individual block by knowing the number of block in one years.
